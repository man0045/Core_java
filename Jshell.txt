java is strongly typed language what does it mean: Every variable, expression, and object has a type (int, double, String, class type, etc.)
Data Types:
1-> Primitive
2-> Non Primitive

In primitive -> Integer, float, characters, Boolean
Integer->
int -> 4bytes
long -> 8bytes
short -> 2bytes
byte -> 1byte
float-> 4bytrs
double -> 8bytes

to defining float values we can define like
double num = 5.6f
for char 
it is of 2bytes and can be expressed in UNICODE
Boolean -> true or false
