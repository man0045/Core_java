here we can easily ensure that the jshell of the system where easily undrstood by writteing in cmd only jshell
and we can easily able to accessible

java is strongly typed language what does it mean: Every variable, expression, and object has a type (int, double, String, class type, etc.)
Data Types:
1-> Primitive
2-> Non Primitive

In primitive -> Integer, float, characters, Boolean
Integer->
int -> 4bytes
long -> 8bytes
short -> 2bytes
byte -> 1byte
float-> 4bytrs
double -> 8bytes

to defining float values we can define like
double num = 5.6f
for char 
it is of 2bytes and can be expressed in UNICODE
Boolean -> true or false
chapter 3:
Type casting and type conversion 
two types of type conversion one is Explicit Conversion and Second is Implicit Conevsrdion
Explicit Conversion -> int(str)
implicit is llinke assigning one from other
like int a = 1234
and string b = "453"
(b = a) -> this become some where equal to Implicit type conversion
jagged Array is an array which is used to create a array of different length manually
if the Inheritace will not be extended it can not be called and shows on the system of data and flows
//Final Keyword 

Final Keyword(Variable) -> can be used as a keyword =, with a variable, or with a methods as well

By using with variable it makes the cariable constant it does not get changed
final class: -> once we make our class final we are making it to avoid inheritance
final methods: ->it is mostly used for the to avoid the methods overriding
abstract method will be only feasible with  abstract class

ABstract class can have normal methods also
Question --> Is it compulsary that have an abstract method in abstract class , Ans Is No
